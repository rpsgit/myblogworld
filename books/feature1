# ðŸ“– Summary: Map of Consciousness

David R. Hawkins introduces a scale of human consciousness that ranks emotions, thoughts, and states of being on a logarithmic scale from **0 to 1000**, where higher levels represent greater truth, love, and spiritual awareness.

## Key Ideas

- **Consciousness is measurable** â€“ calibrated through kinesiology (muscle testing).  
- **Lower levels (Below 200)** drain energy, linked to destructive emotions.  
- **Courage (200)** is the tipping point â€“ moving from weakness to power.  
- **Higher levels (Above 500)** correspond to unconditional love, joy, peace, and enlightenment.  
- **Each level influences reality** â€“ how we perceive life, relationships, and spiritual growth.

## ðŸŽ¯ Goal
Progress upward, transcending fear, anger, pride, and guilt toward peace and enlightenment.
